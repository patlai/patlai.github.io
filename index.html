              avoidance was done by implementing a bang-bang feedback controller that would be fed readings from 3 ultrasonic
              sensors passed through median filters. The robot would build towers by using a claw mechanism that was able
              to grab blocks and stack them on top of each other. In order to keep track of its position on the grid, an
              odometer was implemented by reading the motor rotation and corrected by reading the grid lines with a light
              sensor.</p>

            <p>From September to December 2017, I took on an internship / co-op term at CAE (formerly Canadian Aviation Electronics),
              a company that builds realistic flight simulators. I was placed on the Immersive Environment group as part
              of the automation team. Our role in the company was to develop an automation tool that would be able to automatically
              validate various immersive environment assets such as 3-D vehicle models, and rendering of various scenery
              such as airports and landscapes for the simulators. This would greatly reduce the time taken up by manual testing,
              as automated tests can be run overnight without any user input</p>

            <h4>Montreal, QC, Canada</h4>
            <p>Since May 2016, I have been working as a Software Developer at Sensequake, a Montreal-based startup that seeks
              to revolutionize the field of structural health monitoring and analysis through the use of sensing tests and
              innovative software. I have done 2 summer internships at the company along with working part-time as a contractor
              during the school year. My role on the team was to develop the
              <a href="http://www.sensequake.com/software">3-Dimensional Seismic Assessment (3D-SAM) software</a>. This is a Windows Desktop Application built in C# using
              .NET framework v4.5 and various open-source libraries such as Math .NET numerics, OxyPlot, and Helix3D.</p>
            <p>As the company is still very young and the team small, I was one of the only developers working on the project
              for a large portion of the time, and as a result had to make many challenging decisions regarding system architecture
              and implementation choices on my own. My current accomplishments include: Complete integration of modal analysis
              and processing of sensor data into the software, optimization of many algorithms that were previously prototyped
              in MatLab and Mathematica, redesigning the application interface using WPF to improve user experience, and
              improving various existing parts of the software such as building animation and data importing. The 3D-SAM
              software was recently

          Team and am currently co-captain of the McGill club team.</p>
        <p>Dragon Boat is a high-intensity water sport that originated in ancient China and involves 20 paddlers, a steer, and
          a drummer in a large boat. It is a primarily sprint sport with main distances of 500m, 200m, 2km, and 1km and is
          quickly gaining popularity in Europe and North America after being known in Asia for thousands of years.</p>
